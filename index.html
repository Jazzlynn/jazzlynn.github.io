<h1> <div style="color:green;"> Marcel the Shell </h1>

<h2> <font size="2"> <p> Marcel the Shell is a youtube channel about, well, a shell named Marcel!
I love Marcel because he has a great sense of humor, he is so smart, and super cute of course. Marcel 
talks about a number of different topics. He talks about his losing his sister, enjoying getting a feel 
for "daily life," and even sings a song. There are three episodes of Marcel the Shell. My friends and I 
love Marcel so much because he always makes us laugh.</h2>
<h3> <div style="color:green;"><p>In the episode of the series, Marcel of course inroduces himself. He 
immediately begins fumbling over his words mistaking his name as "Marshell." He also names some
traits that he has such as shoes and being able to talk. So from the beginning Marcel is just this funny
little shell. And the audience can relate to him because of his humor and the fact that he makes mistakes.</h3>
 <h4> <div style="color:black;"> <p>I think that everyone should watch Marcel the Shell because humor is the 
best type of medicine. This is also a cute mini series to watch with the entire family:) So far there are only three 
episodes, but I wish more episodes would be made. I have tried to explain Marcel to you somewhat, however you really
need to see Marcel in order to truly appreciate him! Follow the links below to take you to each episode, ENJOY!!!!!! </h4>

to plants. 
<p>This is right before he sneezes and blows himself off of the fence
(pictured below)
<p> Marcel is embarassed about this but of course the audience just thinks it is cute!.
